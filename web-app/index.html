    <p>This project presents a comprehensive approach to non-invasive glucose monitoring tailored for elderly diabetic patients, integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cloud computing. Through an extensive literature review, existing research on ML algorithms and IoT devices is surveyed, highlighting prevalent challenges related to accuracy, portability, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

    <p>Building upon this foundation, the proposed model adopts the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for non-invasive glucose monitoring, employing MAX30100 sensors and ESP32 microcontrollers to facilitate real-time predictions. Integration with cloud computing is realized through Digilocker, ensuring secure storage and offline accessibility of sensitive health data. The IoT components encompass MAX30100 sensors, ESP32 microcontrollers, a 16x2 LCD screen, and Power Supply v1.2, forming the fundamental infrastructure of the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.</p>
    
    <p>Implementation strategies encompass data aggregation, visualization, and analysis, while addressing challenges such as limited data storage and app integration. The primary objective of the project is to furnish an effective and user-friendly CGM system, aimed at addressing prevailing challenges and empowering elderly diabetic patients with real-time insights into their glucose levels. The paper concludes by deliberating on the potential impact of the proposed model on diabetes management and underscores the necessity for continued research and development to enhance its capabilities.</p>
